# regex_engine
A simplified regex engine made in C++. Implements a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) using recursive descent parsing and matches strings by traversing the structure.
The following symbols are implemented: '^' '$' '|' '.' '*' '?' '+' '\' [[^]set of characters] {quantifier range}
